## Description
I decided to try something noone else has before. I made a bot to automatically trade stonks for me using AI and machine learning.
I wouldn't believe you if you told me it's unsecure! vuln.c **![Screenshot from 2023-11-13 09-18-51](https://github.com/pixie-nukes/picoCTF/assets/94845416/50625085-a913-4302-839c-bd28cd5fccb3)**

## Approach
I connected through netcat in the terminal and found something like this:

I tried messing with it by `%x` 100 times. And got the output as:

It looked like hex so I copied this text and put this in an Hexadecimal Convertor like [this](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-ascii.html)
And here's the output:

I got something like this
> ocip{FTC0l_I4_t5m_ll0m_y_y3nbc7ceac6ÿ¦}
This was not in the right order, so I used an online compiler and write a code like this one to get the actual flag.

## Output
picoCTF{I_l05t_4ll_my_m0n3y_c7cb6cae}
