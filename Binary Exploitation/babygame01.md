## Description
Get the flag and reach the exit. Welcome to BabyGame! Navigate around the map and see what you can find! The game is available to download here. There is no source available, so you'll have to figure your way around the map.
You can connect with it using **nc saturn.picoctf.net 53593**.

## Approach
- I downloaded the game file and then connected to the [server](saturn.picoctf.net) using netcat at the given port.
- I used the `W,A,S,D` keys to navigate to `x`.
- I got `You Win!` but no flag, so I tried by copying the game file loaction and then pasting it after connecting it to the server through netcat but again go the same response (`You Win!`).
- I searched online for decompilers to decompile the `ELF 32-bit LSB Executable` file.
> I found this [decompiler](https://dogbolt.org/?id=3b1456fc-43f7-41df-ac31-a4db11e832d2) helpful to decompile the file.
- The variable **local_aa4** is responsible for then value of the flag. The value of variable must not be **0**. So we must move **0** to a place where we get the flag.
- I wandered around the map but no use, so I thought of gong out of the map so when i went out of the map upto **4** places I got the following:

- So I went to the `x` position using *W,A,S,D* commands.
- And I got the flag!
