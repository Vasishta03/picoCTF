## Description
Attackers have hidden information in a very large mass of data in the past, maybe they are still doing it. Download the data **here**.

## Approach
I opened the file in a text editor and simply searched for **picoCTF** and recovered the flag.

## Output
picoCTF{gr3p_15_@w3s0m3_4c479940}
