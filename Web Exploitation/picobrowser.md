## Description
This website can be rendered only by picobrowser, go and catch the flag! 
[link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/26704/)

## Approach
I pressed the flag button and it says for me as 
> You're not picobrowser! Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/119.0
That string of text is known as a [User-Agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent) and it tells the server what browser you're using. (I Learned from google)
To convince them that I am running pico browser, I can just change the user-agent string.
I chose to use `curl` because it easily allows you to control the headers.
I ran the following command:
`curl --user-agent "picobrowser" "https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/26704/flag"`
And I found the flag in the code.
