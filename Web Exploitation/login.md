## Description
My dog-sitter's brother made this website but I can't get in; can you help?
**[Login](https://login.mars.picoctf.net/)**

## Approach
I right clicked to view the **page source**. and found the *index.js* file quite interesting which I later opened to find out that it had something in base64 like this:

I converted the text from **base64 >> ASCII** to find the flag.

## Output
picoCTF{53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r}
