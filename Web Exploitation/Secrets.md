## Description
We have several pages hidden. Can you find the one with the flag? The website is running [here](http://saturn.picoctf.net:65455/)

## Approach
According to Hint: folder folder folder, the flag is probably stored in the deeper folder
So I go to `http://saturn.picoctf.net:65455/secret/hidden/`
In the website we can see another `superhidden` file 
So i went to `http://saturn.picoctf.net:65455/secret/hidden/superhidden/`
