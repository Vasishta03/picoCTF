## Description
I sent out 2 invitations to all of my friends for my birthday! I'll know if they get stolen because the two invites look similar, and they even have the same md5 hash, but they are slightly different! You wouldn't believe how long it took me to find a collision.
Anyway, see if you're invited by submitting 2 PDFs to my [website](http://mercury.picoctf.net:50970/)

## Approach
the words md5 and collision made me thinking why not a website so i searched for `md5 collision` and found this [website](https://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/md5collision/).
It provided 2 executable files, `hello` and `erase`. I downloaded the files and converted them to pdf since it asked me to submit the file in pdf format in the website.

I uploaded those two files and the website redirected to the [PHP](http://mercury.picoctf.net:50970/index.php):

I found the flag at the end of the PHP (before the HTML portion)

## Output
picoCTF{c0ngr4ts_u_r_1nv1t3d_73b0c8ad}
