## Description
Can you get the flag? Here's the [website](http://saturn.picoctf.net:58179/).
We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt but the website is filtering absolute file paths.
Can you get past the filter to read the flag?

## Approach
According to the description, we know to go up 4 directories because `/usr/share/nginx/html/` is 4 subdirectories from `/`
So clicking "Read" displays the file.
`../../../../../flag.txt`

## Output
picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_6db46514}
