## Description
Find the flag being held on this server to get ahead of the competition [http://mercury.picoctf.net:47967/](http://mercury.picoctf.net:47967/index.php?)

## Approach
I right clicked on the page to view the page source. The page source is as follows:
![Screenshot from 2023-11-08 17-39-34](https://github.com/pixie-nukes/picoCTF/assets/94845416/aa123b2f-66a0-4727-b36d-87366724b552)
There are two clues in the html code given above. They are the methods **GET,POST**. 
So i used the command below in terminal using the `curl` command:
`curl -I GET -i http://mercury.picoctf.net:47967/index.php?` 
With the GET command along with -I to show the document info only.
And i got the flag as follows:
