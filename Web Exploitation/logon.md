# logon
## Description
The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as Joe and find what they've been looking at? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/13594/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:13594
## Hint
Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for Joe's?

Whatever username and password we use, It logs us in but we don't get the flag. 
So I inspected the code and went to check whether i can find something the storage section.

So I tried changing the value of **admin** from `false` to `true`. And I refreshed the page to get the flag.
